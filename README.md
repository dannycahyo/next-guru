# Integrating with tRPC

This branch covers integrating tRPC in a Next.js application.

## Description

In this lesson, we will learn how to integrate tRPC in a Next.js application. tRPC is a framework for building typesafe APIs, and it is designed to work with Next.js out of the box.

## Getting Started

To get started with this lesson, clone this repository and switch to the `trpc-integration` branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannycahyo/next-guru.git
git checkout trpc-integration
```

Since we're adding tRPC dependency, don't forget to sync the dependencies by running `yarn install`.

## Lesson Content

- Setting up tRPC in a Next.js project
- Defining your API routes using tRPC routers
- Querying your API from the client using tRPC client
- Understanding the benefits of type safety with tRPC
